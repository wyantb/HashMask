          <h2><a id="intro" href="#intro">About HashMask</a></h2>
          <p>
            HashMask is a browser extension for your password fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's meant to help you prevent some errors logging into various sites.
            It does this by giving you a consistent sparkline representing your
            passwords.  On any site you visit with a password field, start typing,
            and a little colored sparkline will appear.  This is your clue -
            try and remember something about the color, shape, or both, and before
            you know it, your login error rate will drop immensely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it's just an aid - if you can't remember all your hashes, 
            don't worry about it!  It's just a visual aid.  Use it, or not, however
            you want.  Perhaps only remembering one or two really important hashes
            for a password you forget or mistype often would be useful, or perhaps
            you can try to remember all of them.  Either way, it's up to you.
          </p>

          <h2><a id="faq" href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
          We have here some questions you might be thinking.  As we notice more,
          we'll go ahead and update this list.
          <section>
            <h3><a id="faq-1" href="#faq-1">Q1 - How could I possibly memorize all these sparklines?</a></h3>
            Well, you don't have to, really.  As we said in 
            <a href="#intro">the intro</a>, they're just meant to be aids.
            Remember some of, or all of, your personal sparklines, whatever works for
            you.  We don't store or change anything about passwords sent to the
            website you're on, we only make a visible change in your browser.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3><a id="faq-2" href="#faq-2">Q2 - Couldn't someone guess my password from these sparklines?</a></h3>
            Not really.  See, by default, we generate a random 
            <a href="#salt">salt</a> for you.  Any password you type into any site
            is combined with that random salt, then hashed, and then converted to a
            visual sparkline.  So an attacker (that guy looking at the sparkline over
            your shoulder) would have to have both a perfect replay of your visual
            hashes and your salt to be able to reproduce your password.  There are much
            easier methods to attack a victim, so HashMask really doesn't make you any
            more vulnerable to any attacker.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3><a id="faq-3" href="#faq-3">Q3 - Is there a maximum number of attempts that I can make?</a></h3>
            No, you're free to try any number of combinations with HashMask.  You 
            press a key, and we'll update your sparkline.  That's it.  The security
            comes from the random <a href="#salt">salt</a> that we generate for you
            and <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html#execution-environment">
            your browser keeping addons in an isolated world</a>.  Not to mention a 
            few extra options to make it yet harder for an attacker to duplicate 
            your HashMask settings.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3><a id="faq-4" href="#faq-4">Q4 - I found a problem!</a></h3>
            Dang, guess our code's not perfect.  File an issue for us,
            <a href="http://www.github.com/wyantb/HashMask/issues">right here on github</a>.
            If you don't have a github account, you can contact the main developer
            directly <a href="mailto:wyantb@gmail.com">wyantb@gmail.com</a>.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3><a id="faq-5" href="#faq-5">Q5 - I'm a web developer.  Can I include HashMask on my site?</a></h3>
            Well, technically, you could.  We don't suggest it, however.  See, we want you to
            remember the <a href="#salt">salt</a> that we generate for every user.
            That's the key to the security of HashMask.  There's really no good way
            for an individual site to generate a salt for each user, so we wouldn't
            recommend trying it.  Furthermore, user choice - some people could just
            find it irritating, maybe it slows down their browsing experience, or 
            maybe they just use <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or other
            similar software to manage their passwords already.
