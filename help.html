          <h2><a href="#intro">About HashMask</a></h2>
          <p>
            HashMask is a browser extension for your password fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's meant to help prevent some errors when logging into various websites.
            It does this by giving you a consistent sparkline representing your
            passwords.  On any site you visit with a password field, start typing,
            and a little colored sparkline will appear.  This is your clue -
            try and remember something about the color, shape, or both.  Before
            you know it, your login error rate will drop immensely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it's just an aid - if you can't remember all your sparklines, 
            don't worry about it!  It's just a visual aid.  Use it, or not, however
            you want.  Perhaps only remembering one or two really important sparklines 
            for a password you forget or mistype often would be useful, or perhaps
            you can try to remember all of them.  Either way, it's up to you.
          </p>

          <h2><a id="faq" href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
          We have here some questions you might be thinking.  As we notice more,
          we'll go ahead and update this list.
          <section id="faq-1">
            <h3><a href="#faq-1">Q1 - How could I possibly memorize all these sparklines?</a></h3>
            Well, you don't have to, really.  As we said in 
            <a href="#intro">the intro</a>, they're just meant to be aids.
            Remember some of, or all of, your personal sparklines, whatever works for
            you.  We don't store or change anything about passwords sent to the
            website you're on, we only make a visible change in your browser.
          </section>
          <section id="faq-2">
            <h3><a href="#faq-2">Q2 - Couldn't someone guess my password from these sparklines?</a></h3>
            Not really.  See, by default, we generate a random 
            <a href="#salt">salt</a> for you.  Any password you type into any site
            is combined with that random salt, then <a href="#help-hash">hashed</a>, and then converted to a
            visual sparkline.  So an attacker (that guy looking at the sparkline over
            your shoulder) would have to have both a perfect replay of your visual
            hashes and your salt to be able to reproduce your password.  There are much
            easier methods to attack a victim, so HashMask really doesn't make you any
            more vulnerable to any attacker.
          </section>
          <section id="faq-3">
            <h3><a href="#faq-3">Q3 - Is there a maximum number of attempts that I can make?</a></h3>
            No, you're free to try any number of combinations with HashMask.  You 
            press a key, and we'll update your sparkline.  That's it.  The security
            comes from the random <a href="#salt">salt</a> that we generate for you
            and <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html#execution-environment" target="_blank">
            your browser keeping addons in an isolated world</a>.  Not to mention a 
            few extra options to make it yet harder for an attacker to duplicate 
            your HashMask settings.
          </section>
          <section id="faq-4">
            <h3><a href="#faq-4">Q4 - I found a problem!</a></h3>
            Dang, guess our code's not perfect.  File an issue for us,
            <a href="http://www.github.com/wyantb/HashMask/issues" target="_blank">right here on github</a>.
            If you don't have a github account, you can contact the main developer
            directly <a href="mailto:wyantb@gmail.com" target="_blank">wyantb@gmail.com</a>.
          </section>
          <section id="faq-5">
            <h3><a href="#faq-5">Q5 - I'm a web developer.  Can I include HashMask on my site?</a></h3>
            Well, technically, you could.  We don't suggest it, however.  See, we want you to
            recall the <a href="#salt">salt</a> that we generate for every user.
            That's the key to the security of HashMask.  There's really no good way
            for an individual site to generate a salt for each user, so we wouldn't
            recommend trying it.  Furthermore, consider user choice - some people could just
            find it irritating, maybe it slows down their browsing experience, or 
            maybe they just use <a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> or other
            similar software to manage their passwords already.

          <article id="help-salt">
            <h3><a href="#help-salt">What does a salt do?</a></h3>
            <p>
              As always, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
              has some pretty good information on salts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of HashMask, we use it to provide an attacker even more
              difficulties in guessing your password.  Even if they can replay
              each image of your sparkline, without the salt that we generate for
              you by default, they can't get your password.
            </p>
            <p>
              We should make special note that your salt will, by default, be different
              on different machines.  Each time you download HashMask onto a different
              browser, we will generate a new salt for you.  If you want to use HashMask
              on different browsers or computers, we advise manually copying your salt
              into those other browsers/machines.  This only needs to be done once,
              so it's not too bad.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article id="help-delay">
            <h3><a href="#help-delay">What does a delay do?</a></h3>
            <p>
              Pretty simple, actually.  It represents, in milliseconds, the amount
              of time lag that occurs before your hash appears.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use a default lag of 0ms, so the HashMask should appear as soon as your
              computer can compute the hash.  Still, if you want to remove your salt
              or something, you can still prevent eavesdroppers from figuring out your
              password by delaying the image hashes that appear.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article id="help-hash">
            <h3><a href="#help-hash">What is a hash algorithm?</a></h3>
            <p>
              As always, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
              has some pretty good information about hash algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of HashMask, we use it to provide you more options.  If
              you select a different hash algorithm than the default (SHA-256),
              it's even harder for an attacker to guess your password, since they
              can't even be sure of which algorithm you're using.
            </p>
            <p>
              We make special note of one factor: SHA-1 is the fastest algorithm.  
              If you're noticing speed problems on any website after installing 
              HashMask, you might try switching to that algorithm (just click the SHA-1
              radio button in the <a href="options.html">options page</a>).
