#HashMask (Firefox)
Inspired by [this demo](http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/09/hashmask-another-more-secure-experiment-in-password-masking/).


##Firefox
HashMask is not yet available for Firefox, though we're planning on hopefully getting a port out soon.
If you'd like to help out with porting, please let us know (via GitHub issues or email).

##So, what is it?
HashMask is a useful extension for anyone browsing the web with Firefox.  
It's a tool that helps you remember your passwords by displaying visual hashes of them as you type.

##Contributing

Most of the important stuff you might want to change is in the src folder.
