#HashMask (Chrome)
Inspired by [this demo](http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/09/hashmask-another-more-secure-experiment-in-password-masking/).


##So, what is it?
HashMask is a useful extension for anyone browsing the web with Chrome.  
It's a tool that helps you remember your passwords by displaying visual hashes of them as you type.

##[Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iijmhgjmfjnibiehilcmbbjffcmgolhn)
HashMask's stable releases are on the Chrome Web Store, along with a video demonstration.
The extension is free, and will work on recent versions of Chrome and Chromium.
