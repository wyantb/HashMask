#What to learn first (from most important to less important)
0. The absolute basics of Mercurial.
1. A basic understanding of HTML 5 and Chrome extensions. Try to understand manifest.json and popup.html for now. Please avoid putting tags like <a>, <b>, and <i> in your HTML code, try to learn the HTML 5 way of doing thigns (avoid making things look pretty in HTML, do that in CSS and use HTML for page structure). HTML 5 code should look a lot cleaner and simpler than HTML 4 code. If you do use tags that are deprecated, I will warn you and help you figure out how to use CSS to do it the HTML 5 way. If I see a <blink> tag in your code, I will either laugh or get very mad at you.
2. A basic understanding of JavaScript and jQuery. For jQuery, try to learn a little bit about selectors and events (which are also in JavaScript, but jQuery has nicer tools for them).
3. Some CSS, if you want to start making HTML pages look pretty (but don't worry about this much, since I can handle the more advanced stuff). However, since we will be dealing with editing CSS properties of the HTML DOM (document object model), it would be nice to know the basics so we can style generated graphs and learn the CSS selectors used for grabbing objects in jQuery.

#The three core languages of web development
- HTML: structure (making a document to work with)
- CSS: styling (making things pretty)
- JavaScript: scripting (making things interactive)

	- CSS: http://w3schools.com/css
	- JavaScript: http://w3schools.com/js

- HTML 5, CSS 3 (Learn these after you already know some HTML/CSS, as they're not full tutorials but information about changes in HTML 5 and CSS 3.)

	- CSS 3: http://w3schools.com/css3

- MERCURIAL

- VALIDATORS
	- This is more advanced stuff, for when you have a better understanding of HTML and CSS. Don't even worry about this until you have at least the basics down. These are software tools that will check to make sure your HTML and CSS files are standards compliant and do not have any issues. Please note that they are extremely picky, and will try to hurt your feelings. It's okay to get a ton of validation issues when you're starting off. Also, you should always use a (preferably HTML 5) doctype (http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_doctype.asp) in your HTML files. If it complains about you using the experimental HTML 5 validator, that's okay. Feel free to email me if you have any questions

# About this document
I (Nicolas McCurdy) wrote this, hoping it would be a helpful introduction for what we should learn. I might share a Google Doc with you guys that's more in depth, but for now I think this is a good starting point for what should be learned and what tutorials are handy. If you are confused, want to ask me something, want to leave a comment about this, or have a funny idea about how you could put <marquee> tags around all of our HTML documents, you can email me at thenickperson@gmail.com. Also, this will hopefully get updated in the future and/or be converted to a Google Doc.
